# Overview

As a software engineer, this project is a part of my ongoing learning journey to expand my skills in software development. The software I've built is an Expense Tracker Application designed to manage personal finances efficiently. It seamlessly integrates with a SQL Relational Database to store, organize, and retrieve expense-related data. Users can add, edit, and delete expenses via a user-friendly interface, providing an intuitive way to monitor their expenditures.

The primary goal behind developing this software is to enhance my proficiency in database management, user interface design, and backend development using SQL and Python. 

To see a detailed demonstration, code walkthrough, and an overview of how I created the Relational Database, watch the [Software Demo Video](https://www.loom.com/share/76dfe3fc7c8e4995a297068f30cbb7cf) (4-5 minutes).

# Relational Database

The Expense Tracker Application utilizes a SQL Relational Database for efficient data management. The database includes the following structure:

- **Table: expenses**
  - Columns:
    - `id` (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT)
    - `description` (TEXT)
    - `category` (TEXT)
    - `amount` (REAL)
    - `date` (DATE)

# Development Environment

**Tools Used:**
- IDE: Visual Studio Code
- Database Management System: SQLite Python
- Version Control: Git

**Programming Language & Libraries:**
- Python
  - tkinter
  - matplotlib
  - tkcalendar
  - sqlite3

# Future Work

To enhance the Expense Tracker Application further, here are future improvements and features to consider:

- Implement user authentication and login functionality.
- Add data visualization features for expense analysis.
- Enhance UI/UX for improved user interaction.
